Alcohol display on Serial monitor:

1. Read the values obtained at pin A0 of the NodeMCU board.
2. Take the average of every 100 values taken as a reading.
3. The reading is then divided by 1024 and multiplied by 
scaling factor (i.e . 5). This is the received voltage reading.
4.The value of the sensor resistance is then obtained through
 the voltage divider circuit consisting of VCC and the voltage reading.
5.Divide the obtained value of sensor resistance with R0. 
Here R0 is the value of resistance obtained by dividing the
 value of the sensor resistance as measured in clear air by 60.
 Here 60 is chosen as it is observed from the sensitivity 
characteristics graph as shown in the MQ3 datasheet. 
It can be observed that the ratio of Rs/R0 is 60 for clean air.
 Refer datasheet of MQ-3 for the graph https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/MQ-3.pdf
6.Thus we obtain the ratio Rs/R0 for the specific alcohol/ gas
 in the surrounding. This ratio is equivalent to the corresponding
 Y-axis value. Thus through the graph of fig, we can obtain the 
corresponding concentration in mg/L.
7.Thus we know the y co-ordinate. We have to calculate the 
x co-ordinate. However as we can observe from fig, the graph 
is not linear. We cannot use regular straight line equation.
8. Hence we obtain the best fit line joining most points of 
the datasheet graph using Linear Regression. Here, we have performed it for Ethanol.
9.10 points were taken on the graph. The x co-ordinates are 
stored in an array while the corresponding  y co-ordinates are stored in another array.
10.Using Linear Regression gives the equation as x = (y - a)/b.
11.The value of coefficient a and b is calculated using the 
Linear regression formulae. 
Refer: http://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/regression-analysis/find-a-linear-regression-equation/.
12.Then using the equation x = (y-a)/b, the corresponding value 
of x i.e. the concentration of the alcohol/gas in mg/L is obtained.
13.The value is displayed on the Serial monitor.
